# BacktestingEV

## Presentation

This package will allow you to back-test your forecasting model.
We provide you a certain amount of functions to be applied to a prediction model within the known data.

You will be able to use some simple back-testing functions (as analysing the average values of prediction) and also more complexe ones to evaluate the extreme values of the model.
A meaninful part of the work has been granted to the Extreme Values Theory (EVT).

Notice : throughout this project we note Extreme Values as EV.


## Installation
